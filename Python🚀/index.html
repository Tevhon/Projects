                    Python is a computer <span>programming language</span> often used to build websites and software,
                     automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning 
                     it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isnâ€™t specialized for any 
                     specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it 
                     one of the most-used programming languages today.Stack Overflow's 2022 Developer Survey 
                     revealed that Python is the fourth most popular programming language, with respondents
                     saying that they use Python almost 50 percent of the time in their development work. 
                     Survey results also showed that Python is tied with Rust as the most-wanted technology,
                     with 18% percent of developers who aren't using it already saying that they are interested 
                     in learning Python
